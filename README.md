# Codefights
> Curated list of solutions and some explanations of exercises on codefights.

This repository is primarily for me to review solutions that I've completed on codefights,
and to share knowledge amongst peers who want to compare solutions.

Pull requests and constructive code tips are welcome if you have a better solution that has 
already been completed!
